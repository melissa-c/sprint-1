Command line is a way of telling a computer what to do or where to go by typing text instructions rather than seeing a window with folders and clicking or moving with a mouse.

Terminal commands:
1. pwd (print working directory): This tels you which folder you are currently in.
2.cd (change directory): This lets you enter another folder.
3. ls (list directory): This shows you what files and folders are inside the folder you are in.
4. mv (move): This lets you move a file from one folder to another or to rename a file depending on what other instructions you write.
5. cp (copy): This lets you copy a file or folder.
6. touch (make new file): This creates a new file.
7. rm (remove): This deletes a file or folder permanently.
8. mkdir (make new directory): This creates a new folder.
9. cat (show file content): This displays the contents of the file into the terminal screen.
10. > (redirect right): This uses the information from the left side of the > symbol to replace the content of the file on the right of the > symbol.
